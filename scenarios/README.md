# Scenarios folder

Actual demo scenarios that provide automation for building and setting up the
demo environment. This is the single source of truth to initiate a demo scenario
and everything that is required to setup a proper staged environment.

It's not necessarily a folder for scripting single script assets or functions.
Scripts assets are located at this path: `<project root folder>/scripts/`
