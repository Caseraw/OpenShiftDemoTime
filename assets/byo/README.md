# Bring your own assets folder

This is where you'll be storing privacy/sensitive information to support the
environment setup. Make sure to NOT commit anything here into git!!! As a
precautionary step a `.gitignore` file is created excluding files and folders
within this directory to be committed into git. Unfortunately its not a complete
secure soluton. So proceed at your own risk.
